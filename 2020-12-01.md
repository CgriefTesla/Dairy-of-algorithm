# Day4 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays #

  From: Leetcode

  Difficulty: Hard
  
## Description of the problem ##
  
    Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

    Follow up: The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

## Examples1 ##

    Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
    Output: 2.00000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
    
## Examples2 ##

    Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
    Output: 2.50000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
    
## Examples3 ##

    Input: nums1 = [0,0], nums2 = [0,0]
    Output: 0.00000
    
## Examples4 ##

    Input: nums1 = [], nums2 = [1]
    Output: 1.00000
    
## Examples4 ##

    Input: nums1 = [2], nums2 = []
    Output: 2.00000
    
## Constraints: ##

    nums1.length == m
    nums2.length == n
    0 <= m <= 1000
    0 <= n <= 1000
    1 <= m + n <= 2000
    -106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106

## Core of thought ##

    The core difficulty is time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). So perhaps we must use recursive function. 

    Because the two arrays are sorted, so the problem becomes easier. First idea comes into my mind is that everytime, comparing the two arrays' range, finding the median of 
    the bigger one, and find which position the bigger range array's median should be in the smaller range array. Every time we cut at least half of the bigger range array's 
    items, it's kind of like binary search.  To be continued...sleep,

    I knew my code is very awful, but may there are some bugs in leetcode.

    And for my code was criticized by friends it is so long and awful, this time I'll not attach it. Because I think he is right, I need to imporve this part of myself.
    
    So, I'll pretend that I solved it. ^_^
