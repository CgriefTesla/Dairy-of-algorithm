# Day3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters #

## Description of the problem ##

    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Examples and details ##

   Example 1:
    
      Input: s = "abcabcbb"
      Output: 3
      Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
      
   Example 2ï¼š
    
      Input: s = "bbbbb"
      Output: 1
      Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
      
   Example 3:
    
      Input: s = "pwwkew"
      Output: 3
      Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
      Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
      
   Example 4:
    
      Input: s = ""
      Output: 0
      
## Constraints: ##
    
    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
    
    
## Thought ##

  After simply thinking about this problem, the first idea comes into my mind is using 2 pointer to scan the string twice. First storing the string into a List. Next letting 
  2 pointers point to the first character, we call them ___head___ and ___tail___. Then let ___tail___ move to the end of the list, if the character that ___tail___ pointing 
  is repeating, then move the ___head___ to next character of the same character as the ___tail___ pointing to. In this process we record the max length. 


## Code ##

    class Solution(object):
      def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
          """
          :type s: str
          :rtype: int
          """
          
          # literally, here are the definition of two pointer
          head_pointer = 0
          tail_pointer = 0
          
          # length of the string
          lens_of_s = len(s)
          
          # the max length record
          max_lens = 0
          
          # the set contains current no-repeating characters
          cur_set = set()
          
          # process of pointer moving
          while tail_pointer < lens_of_s :
              # if the character pointed by the tail_pointer, then we have to move the head_pointer and remove the charaters scaned by the head_pointer untill the same character
                as pointed by the tail_pointer is removed.
                
              #And if right now the head_pointer and tail_pointer is pointing the same charaters, move them both to the next character.
              if s[tail_pointer] in cur_set:
                  if s[head_pointer] == s[tail_pointer]:
                      cur_set.remove(s[head_pointer])
                      head_pointer += 1
                      cur_set.add(s[tail_pointer])
                      tail_pointer += 1
                  else:
                      while s[head_pointer] != s[tail_pointer]:
                          cur_set.remove(s[head_pointer])
                          head_pointer += 1
                      cur_set.remove(s[head_pointer])
                      head_pointer += 1
                      
              # If the new character is not in the set, then add it in and move the tail_pointer.And compare the length of the set with the max_length, record the bigger one.
              else:
                  cur_set.add(s[tail_pointer])
                  tail_pointer += 1
                  if len(cur_set) > max_lens:
                      max_lens = len(cur_set)

          return max_lens
