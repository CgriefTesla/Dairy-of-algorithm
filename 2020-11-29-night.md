# Day 2 Add Two Numbers #

From: Leetcode

Difficulty: Medium

## Description of the problem ##
  
  You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.  
  
  You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Thought ##

  The key point here maybe is the word ___reverse___ because I think it is very time costing to go the straight way, extract the digits one by one in reverse.
  
  Suddenly, the next idea in my mind is to use a array to save the linked list. And the constraint states that the number of each linked list is in the range [1, 100]
  
  Maybe a 100 length array is a not bad idea, I'll try it.
  
  Now I'm thinking about how to combine all the digits into a number. Obviously, the Program's type conversion must be more efficient than mine. So I'm kind of curious about this.
  
  Then I realize that even the float type could not represent a 100-digit number. So we need to type the number one digit by one digit.
  
  It becomes easier, I want to try add the digits next by next, and if the result is bigger than 10, then there is a carry digit added into the next digit. Of course we may use another
  linked list to save the results, but for the original linked list in no longer useful we could use them and just do some work on the pointers. I'll try the code tomorrow, now it's
  too late. I need to go to sleep. 
  
  See you.
