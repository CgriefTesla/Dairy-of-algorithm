# Day1 - Two Sum
  From: Leetcode
  
  Difficulty: Easy


 ## Description of the problem ##
  Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return __indices__ of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

 

## Example 1: ##

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

## Constraints: ##

2 <= nums.length <= 103

-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

-109 <= target <= 109

Only one valid answer exists.



## Core of thought

  If we compare all the pairs of the list, we must cost O(nÂ²), if we have a sorted list we could essentially scan the list one time which means time cost is O(n). 

   Assuming __i__ is the head pointer of the list, __j__ is the tail pointer.
   
   At the beginning, __i__ is 0, __j__ is the length of list minus 1
   
   We could set a variable called __sum__ as __sorted_nums[i] + sorted_nums[j]__,
                Every time if we find that __sum__ is larger than __target__, we let __j = j - 1__
                if the sum is less than target, we let __i = i + 1__

  So the upper bound of time cost is decided by the sort function.
  Then I think quick sort is a good choice for this situation. Also you may use some sort algorithm with time cost O(n), because the range of the nums and length of the list is not too big,
  but I haven't see that constraint before I solved it so I used quick sort.

                    base = nums[start]
                    while m < n:
                        while (m < n) and ( nums[n] >= base):
                            n = n -1
                        nums[m] = nums[n]

                        while(m < n) and ( nums[m] <= base ):
                            m = m + 1
                        nums[n] = nums[m]

                    nums[m] = base

                    quicksort(nums, start, m-1)
